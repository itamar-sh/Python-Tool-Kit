ledge,"מדף<hr>“You see that ledge down there?” </hr>“I have to go down there, to that ledge,” he told the wisps. </hr>He leaned out over the edge of the cliff, looking down at the ledge far below. </hr>“Kell,” Dockson said, “do you have to stand on the ledge like that? "
ledger,"ספר חשבונות<hr>Renoux asked, pouring over another ledger. "

lenient,"מקל<hr>“Besides,” Kelsier said, “the Lord Ruler is far more lenient with the nobility than he is with skaa. </hr>In fact, I now know that amongst plantation lords, mine was actually rather lenient.” "
lest,"שמא<hr>She had to put her mind to other things lest she end up being so sad thinking about him that she start to weep. </hr>He extinguished his tin lest his enhanced eyes be blinded when he entered the lit room, and threw open the door. "
lettering,אותיות<hr>She had picked it for its large lettering—was paper really so expensive that scribes needed to cram as many lines to a page as possible?

lug,לוג<hr>It was a grueling effort to lug the heavy load up the precipitous trail. 
lulled,"רגוע<hr>The only one not lulled into indifference and carelessness was Jagang himself. </hr>Kahlan wanted to blend into the monotony of daily life, to have the men guarding her become lulled into thinking of her as innocuous, harmless, even cowed, so that she became just another one of their tedious chores. "
lumber,ברים<hr>The fires were so intense that the lumber cannot be salvaged.

lurched,"משובש<hr>Then her body lurched, pulled upward by the belt. "

malcontent,חוסר שביעות רצון<hr>It couldn’t have been very effective for a malcontent mob of fools to attack such a place. 
malleable,"חמרן<hr>“Mistwraiths have malleable bodies,” Kelsier said. "
mangled,"מבולבל<hr>With amusement, he noticed a twisted form lying on the cobblestones a short distance away—the mangled remains of the hazekiller he’d thrown out the window. "
manicured,"מטופח<hr>Estates rolled in the distance—each one walled, manicured, and well guarded. "
manor,"מנור<hr>Tresting had his own, personal obligators back at the manor, but they were only minor functionaries, with barely a few marks around their eyes. </hr>The manor house was gone. "

marvelous,"נפלא<hr>He is a marvelous actor, but he feels very uncomfortable with people knowing the specifics of how he took Lord Renoux’s place. "

miller,"טוחן<hr>He was a big man, a miller, from the southern reaches of the Midlands. "

miscreant,"לא מאמין<hr>I’m just a traveling miscreant, here to eat your food and impress your youths.” "
missives,"פספוסים<hr>She wasn't sure why she kept sending her missives, just that she spent so much time writing letters to whichever of her siblings were not in residence in London at the time, and it seemed easy enough to pen a short note to some far-off relative while she was seated at her escritoire. "
Mistress,"פילגש<hr>We are a weak people, Mistress. "
modestly,"בצניעות<hr>“Even among the nobility, Vin, Allomancy is modestly rare,” Kelsier said. "
monotony,"מונוטוניות<hr>Kahlan wanted to blend into the monotony of daily life, to have the men guarding her become lulled into thinking of her as innocuous, harmless, even cowed, so that she became just another one of their tedious chores. "
moping,"ניגוב<hr>Chase would be disappointed to see her giving up so easily, to see her moping, but what was she to do? "
morsels,"חתיכות<hr>Always before, she had needed to be a scrimp with her Luck, holding it in reserve, using up morsels sparingly. "

motifs,מוטיבים<hr>You don’t understand the first thing about such complex motifs.”

muddled,"מבולבל<hr>Mind muddled by terror, she reflexively reached out and Pulled against the ingot, trying to yank herself toward it. "
mundane,"ארצי<hr>He had spoken correctly: The pantry’s offerings had been depressingly mundane. </hr>Vin had never seen him in such mundane clothing before. </hr>Instead of mundane browns and whites, the cultivated plants were of deeper, more vibrant colors—shades of red, orange, and yellow, with the colors concentrated in their leaves. "
murals,"ציורי קיר<hr>In contrast to the simple corridors, this room was covered with silver-inlayed murals. "
navel,"טבור<hr>He turned and poked the goose leg at the young woman’s belly, just below her navel. "

nip,"ניפ<hr>“Losing the stress on the nip,” he said. "

Not,"לא<hr>“Not particularly, no,” Elend said. "
oak,"אלון<hr>They wouldn’t let us proceed any farther than the dead oak woods, or allow us to see the other wisps.” "
obligator,"חובה<hr>The obligator turned, raising an eyebrow—the motion done as if to highlight his most distinctive feature, the intricate tattoos that laced the skin around his eyes. "
oblivious,"מתעלם<hr>The crewleader paused—oblivious of Vin’s touch, yet feeling its effects nonetheless. "
obscurity,"אלמוניות<hr>False Dawn is a stuffy volume, and by not forbidding it, the Ministry doomed it to obscurity.” "
obsidian,"האובסידיאן<hr>That left only the small box that contained her personal effects: a pebble from each city she’d visited, the earring Reen said Vin’s mother had given her, and a bit of obsidian the size of a large coin. "
ominous,"מבשר רעות<hr>The Canton of Finance was hardly the most threatening of Ministry offices—the Canton of Inquisition, or even the Canton of Orthodoxy, had a far more ominous reputation. </hr>Suddenly, with tin, the mists around her didn’t seem so ominous. "
omnipotent,"כל יכול<hr>He’s a powerful Allomancer, but by no means omnipotent.” "
omnipresent,"נוכח בכל מקום<hr>He is the Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.” "
omniscience,ידיעת הכול<hr>Vision through her gift alone had a singular quality that approached omniscience. 
omniscient,"יודע-כל<hr>He is the Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.” "
on,הלאה<hr>Breeze’s attention was still on Yeden and his obvious discomfort.

ooze,"נוטף<hr>She used a sliver of Subtractive Magic to void a razor-thin piece of flesh at the tip of her finger, and used the blood that began to ooze to begin drawing the diagrams needed before the box of Orden. "

orchestra,"תזמורת<hr>A string orchestra played on a platform to her left, providing music for the couples who danced in the very center of the hall. "
ordeal,"חוויה קשה<hr>When Richard went back inside everyone was crowded around Jebra, engaged in hushed conversation filled with sympathy for her ordeal. "
ornamental,"נוי<hr>Cara watched him as he peered around at the paneled walls, his gaze passing methodically over the ornamental oddities on the shelves: the lacquered boxes with inlaid silver designs, the small figures of dancers carved from bone, the smooth stones lying in velvet-lined boxes, and the decorative glass vases. </hr>On burglaries or scouting missions, she had occasionally seen ornamental plants, but she’d never given them much heed—they, like many noble interests, had seemed frivolous to her. "
ornamentation,"קישוט<hr>Still, Vin had rarely worn it, for fear that the ornamentation would make her look more feminine. "
ornate,"מקושט<hr>Richard knew that a number of the rooms were libraries, while others were elaborately decorated rooms seeming to serve no purpose other than to lead to other rooms, which led to other rooms, some simple and some ornate, all a part of the inscrutable and complex maze that was the Keep. </hr>Massive, ornate stone pillars were set into the walls, running between the windows. </hr>And the white one was too ornate. "
ostentatious,"ראוותני<hr>“They’re an ostentatious lot, even for high nobility. </hr>Time to be a bit ostentatious, he thought, dropping a coin to the wood. "
