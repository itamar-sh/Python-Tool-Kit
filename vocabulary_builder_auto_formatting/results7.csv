squirm,"להתפתל<hr>However, Sazed’s calm displeasure made her want to squirm. "
squirmed,התפתל<hr>Vin squirmed a bit beneath their scrutiny.

stool,"שרפרף<hr>Six hadn’t cared at all about the stool. </hr>The boy who had fetched Vin sat on a stool beside Clubs, and he was obviously making a point of trying not to look at her. </hr>He sat on the stool by her bed, hands clasped with his elbows on his knees, watching her by the faint light of a lantern.

stubble,זיפים<hr>She could hear it rasp against his stubble. 
stud,"פתוח<hr>Little more than a stud, not even worth stealing, which was why she didn’t fear leaving it in the back room. </hr>“It’s just a small stud, and the pin on the back bends down.” "
studs,"ומשובץ<hr>His earlobes had been stretched out, and the ears themselves contained studs that ran around their perimeter. "
stumble,למעוד<hr>I fear that I’ll stumble from nervousness on the dance floor.

subjugation,"שעבוד<hr>We are eager to do as we are told, quick to seek subjugation. "
subservient,"כנוע<hr>The skaa might be subservient, but they were incurable gossips. </hr>Make sure you remain subservient, Camon. "

teetered,"מתנודד<hr>It teetered, then fell out the window and began to plummet directly toward Kelsier. "
telltale,"מסגיר<hr>Zedd stared off as he puzzled at the question, the way one would listen for any sound, but Nicci knew that he wasn’t exactly listening for a telltale sound. "
temerity,"תעוזה<hr>Even now, more than a month after it had happened, he couldn't quite believe that the sun had had the temerity to tease him so. "
tenacious,"עקשן<hr>He was nothing if not tenacious. </hr>No, she reflected with a rather impressive (in her opinion, at least) display of self-honesty, there were two things about her that colored her every action— she liked to act quickly and she was tenacious. "

tendrils,קנוקנות<hr>We know how to avoid the Steel Ministry’s tendrils.

tentative,לא סופי<hr>Vin accepted her cup with a tentative hand. 
tentatively,"בהיסוס<hr>She reached out tentatively—not even really sure what she was doing, or why she could even do it. "

the,"ה<hr>“Once, the queen sent an emissary to ask if I would recant my vision. </hr>The Mistborn crewleader burst through the door with his cheery enthusiasm, Dockson sauntering along behind. "

theocracy,תאוקרטיה<hr>“Those Inquisitors won’t just let us throw their pretty theocracy into chaos.”

tongs,"מלקחת<hr>“Then,” he said, turning back, “the inquisitor pushes the jaws of a pair of tongs deep into the belly and gropes around until he is able to grab hold of a bit of the small intestine. "
transfixed,"טרנספיקס<hr>Chapter 4 Richard stood transfixed, staring at Nicci poised in midair just above a heavy library table, a net of glowing green geometric lines tangled all around her. </hr>Six stood transfixed, staring at it as if no one else were there with her. "
transgression,"פשע<hr>Violet had said that it was going to take a long time for Rachel to earn forgiveness for such a serious transgression, and also for showing disrespect by escaping the castle. "

twixt,"טוויקסט<hr>“Why’d he pick you to be his twixt, anyway, Vin?” "
