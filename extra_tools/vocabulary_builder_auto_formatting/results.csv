Canton,"קנטון</hr>I came not only at the behest of Lord Venture, but to . . . look in on some matters for the Canton of Inquisition. </hr>The Canton of Finance was hardly the most threatening of Ministry offices—the Canton of Inquisition, or even the Canton of Orthodoxy, had a far more ominous reputation.

dejection,דכדוך</hr>The skaa she passed had similar airs of dejection.

disarming,"פירוק נשק</hr>The obligator smiled; he likely meant it to be disarming, but Tresting only found it eerie. "

"
finagling,"פינאגלינג</hr>The other crewleader, Theron, had spent five years building, scamming, and finagling to create this moment. "
flair,כשרון</hr>“It has flair—and I do like the idea of having the noblemen kill each other.” 
flakes,"פתיתי</hr>Vin watched the downy flakes drift through the air. </hr>“The vial is filled with an alcohol solution and some flakes of metal, Vin.” "
Flare,פלייר</hr>“Flare?” 
fledgling,"אֶפְרוֹחַ</hr>Tresting nodded as he watched the crowd of lazy skaa, some working with their hoes, others on hands and knees, pushing the ash away from the fledgling crops. "
flexed,גמיש</hr>Vin flexed experimentally. 
flippancy,רפיון</hr>His flippancy was subdued; he seemed to be honestly considering the plan. 
flippant,רפיון</hr>“How can you be so flippant about something like this?”

flustered,"מבולבל</hr>They will assume that you are simply flustered by your first ball, and no harm will be done.” "
fold,"מקפלים</hr>He nodded and started to sit down, trying to fold himself back into the ridiculously small chair, then finally muttering something under his breath, turning to her with a slightly more intelligible, ""Excuse me,"" and moving to another, larger chair. "
fondness,"חיבה</hr>Since the time when Rachel had been with her before, Violet had acquired a new fondness for inflicting pain. "
foolhardy,"טיפש</hr>Groups composed of the extremely skillful, the extremely foolhardy, or the extremely talented. "
foreboding,"מבשר רעות</hr>This feeling was not dread so much as it was a sense of the great, but intangible, weight of foreboding. "
forges,"זיופים</hr>Well, scamming noblemen and obligators was a very dangerous profession—but it certainly beat working in the forges or the textile mills. "
forlorn,"עזוב</hr>If a place could be said to be forlorn, the immense structure of the Keep was such a place. "
former,"לשעבר</hr>E L James FIFTY SHADES DARKER E L James is a former TV executive, wife, and mother of two based in West London. "
formidable,"אימתני</hr>“They seem to be formidable, Excellency. </hr>Eloise Bridgerton, he was coming to realize, had a formidable will. "
forthcoming,בקרוב</hr>Not that you were forthcoming about that fact during our last meeting.” 
fortnight,"שבועיים</hr>""A fortnight,"" she supplied, hoping that was about the right amount of time. "
forward,"קדימה</hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. "
found,"ליסד</hr>He seemed to know as much about the Lord Ruler’s mythology as he did about other religions, though it seemed odd to her that he would study the very religion he found so oppressive. "
foyer,"מסדרון</hr>A crowd of aristocrats was pooling slightly in the foyer, waiting to enter the main hall. "
fragile,שביר</hr>It was hard to imagine a man handling such a fragile bloom. 
frail,שברירי</hr>His leathered skin and bald scalp made him look more frail than they did wise. 
freshly,טרי</hr>He needed just the right one for— He looked up and out the freshly washed glass. 
frilled,"מטומטם</hr>Vin accepted his hand, trying with as much grace as possible to pull the frilled, bulky bottom of her dress out of the carriage. "
fringe,שוליים</hr>The outer fringe of structures had seemed to take the brunt of the weather and as a result were the most deteriorated. 
frivolous,"קל דעת</hr>On burglaries or scouting missions, she had occasionally seen ornamental plants, but she’d never given them much heed—they, like many noble interests, had seemed frivolous to her. </hr>Not that they aren’t frivolous, of course, she thought, inspecting the four gowns. "
functionaries,"בעלי תפקידים</hr>Tresting had his own, personal obligators back at the manor, but they were only minor functionaries, with barely a few marks around their eyes. "
furrows,"תלמים</hr>Eventually, Kelsier sighed, then turned to pick his way across the furrows and pathways, weaving between large heaps of ash. "
gait,"הליכה</hr>With that, the older man turned and stalked in a limping gait from the room, slamming the door behind him. "
Garrison,גריסון</hr>We’re going to find a way to neutralize the Luthadel Garrison—leaving the area without a policing force. 
garrisons,חילות מצב</hr>There are troop garrisons there. 
gash,"גאש</hr>Despite her numb mind, she couldn’t help noticing how big the gash was. "

greasy,שמנוני</hr>The goose leg left a greasy spot on her bare flesh. 
grimaced,מעוות</hr>Eloise grimaced. 
grin,"גרין</hr>It was a sound announcing the approach of death, a sound that would have made the Keeper himself grin.” "
groan,נאנח</hr>He heard himself trying unsuccessfully to groan. 
groomed,"מטופח</hr>None of them smelled like she did, though they were far more cleanly and well groomed than average skaa. "
gruel,"דייסה</hr>“It’s the same method by which the Prelate and her Sisters of the Light know their version of the same gruel to be true. </hr>However, this was a people who had been fed on nothing but soup and gruel since they were children. "
grueling,מפרך</hr>It was a grueling effort to lug the heavy load up the precipitous trail. 
guise,גיז</hr>Perhaps it was the way his eyes regarded her; it seemed like they could see through her guise. 
gullible,"פתי</hr>Such disturbances were bad for business; they made the aristocracy more alert, and less gullible. "
gullies,תעלות</hr>The hills they rode across were rutted with gullies that made it difficult traveling at times. 
haggling,"התמקחות</hr>“No use haggling now, thief,” Yeden snapped. "
Ham,"שינקן</hr>“I wouldn’t worry too much, Yeden,” Ham added. "
handily,"בהישג יד</hr>One day, after a particularly violent game that they had won handily, Johnrock admitted to being confused as to why Richard would have allowed himself to so easily be captured. "
handkerchief,"מטפחת</hr>She glanced down at the bloodied handkerchief. </hr>Vin flared pewter in response, but the item was simply a pink-and-white handkerchief. "
handsomely,"יפה</hr>And rather handsomely, too."" "
harbor,"הארבור</hr>This was the real reason they tolerated him—the reason even the timid peasants would harbor a man such as Kelsier, a skaa who defied the Lord Ruler’s will by traveling from plantation to plantation. "
haunches,"רדיפות</hr>There were human hands, bovine hooves, canine haunches, and others she couldn’t identify. "
haze,"אובך</hr>The time has flown by in a haze of new faces, work to do, and Mr. "
headway,"התקדמות</hr>“Excellency, there were numbers beyond counting, and I stopped counting at several thousand without having made much headway in a full tally. "
hearth,"אח</hr>Kelsier stood, leaning one elbow resting against the brick hearth, a cup of wine in his hand. "
heathens,עובדי אלילים</hr>They were to be the flesh that dulled the swords of the heathens. </hr>“It will do these heathens good to learn our ways. 
hedging,גידור</hr>I’m not hedging—I just said it would take some getting used to.” 
heed,"שימו לב</hr>Yet, it amazes me that anyone would give heed to a man who speaks such hatred. </hr>He didn’t pay the weather much heed, so neither did she. "

heinous,נתעב</hr>“He must have admitted to something heinous during his torture.”

Huddled,"הצטופפו</hr>Huddled under the small overhang, off to the side, she hoped that no one would answer that knock. "
huge,"ענק</hr>You have my unconditional love, always ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Sarah, Kay, and Jada. "
Humor,הומור</hr>Humor me.” 
hunker,"רעב</hr>If it were too dangerous, he’d hunker down and send for his koloss.” "

impaled,משופד</hr>They were impaled on posts placed in the middle of different roads into the city.

inclined,נוטה</hr>Phillip arched a brow as he inclined his head toward Romney Hall. 
incompetent,"לא כשיר</hr>“It took me six months of practice to distinguish pulse lengths—if you’d done it on the first try, I’d have felt incompetent.” "
incongruent,"לא תואם</hr>Kelsier continued to walk, the spring in his step incongruent with the dark gloom. "
incredulous,לא יאומן</hr>Richard was incredulous. 
incurable,"חשוכת מרפא</hr>The skaa might be subservient, but they were incurable gossips. "
indistinct,"לא ברור</hr>The passing guards spun with surprise, but their faces soon became indistinct as Vin fell back down toward the ground. "
indolent,"עצלנות</hr>The peasants were an indolent, unproductive lot. "
inexorably,"באופן בלתי נמנע</hr>With every new line of light, she was being stitched tighter and tighter to her fate, pulled inexorably into the darkness of eternity beyond life. "

ingenious,גאוני</hr>“I prefer to think of myself as ingenious.” 
ingot,"אינגוט</hr>Kelsier Pushed the still airborne ingot, flipping it away from him—and away from the attacking hazekiller, who had his shield raised. </hr>“Put the ingot directly below you, and remember to Steel-push, not Ironpull. "
inkling,אינקלינג</hr>An inkling of something else began to well up in her. 
inquisitor,"אינקוויזיטור</hr>You see, we have this torture where the inquisitor makes a small incision in a lower abdomen of the person in question.” "
insubordinate,"סרבן</hr>“He’s too clever to be insubordinate,” Ham said, “but he’s been making trouble quietly. "
insufferably,"בלתי נסבל</hr>They’re an insufferably efficient lot, I must say.” "
insurrectionists,"מתקוממים</hr>Too many places have been attacked for it to be the doings of insurrectionists.” </hr>“It’s those insurrectionists, mostly from Altur’Rang. "
interconnected,"מחוברים</hr>It was all intricately interconnected—how the power of Orden worked, and how that power functioned through its connection to the world of life. "
Interspersed,משולב</hr>Interspersed throughout the city were a dozen or so monolithic keeps. 
intoxicating,"המשכר</hr>To a Keeper, that’s probably as intoxicating as streetspice. "
intricate,"מורכב</hr>The obligator turned, raising an eyebrow—the motion done as if to highlight his most distinctive feature, the intricate tattoos that laced the skin around his eyes. </hr>It was an intricate job—one of the most complex Vin had ever seen. "
intricately,"בצורה מורכבת</hr>It was all intricately interconnected—how the power of Orden worked, and how that power functioned through its connection to the world of life. "
intrigued,"מסוקרן</hr>She had been intrigued by Sir Phillip's reply, especially his use of the Latin, and she had immediately penned her own response. "
invigorated,"נמרץ</hr>The men are leaving invigorated, and a number of them are staying behind. "
invincible,"בלתי מנוצח</hr>The attacks in their homeland were unsettling the men, who had always considered the Old World not just invulnerable to such attack, but invincible as well. "
invited,"הזמין</hr>Whatever job they were planning, she was invited to participate. "
invocation,להפעלה</hr>I think it would be best to shield it behind an invocation of threes.” 
inwardly,"כלפי פנים</hr>She could maintain a stony face, and rejoice inwardly. "
jaded,"עייף</hr>Funny, how easily one can become jaded, Vin thought. "
jest,"בצחוק</hr>“You jest, but Tepper might have been right. "
juvenile,"ילדותי</hr>Camon had been skilled at impersonating noblemen, but his self-importance had always struck Vin as a bit juvenile. "
keeps,"שומר</hr>Rather than containing imposing, buttressed keeps, it was filled with lavish manors and villas. "
laborer,"פועל</hr>He looked as if he worked outside like a laborer, especially in those rough trousers and shirt with no cravat. "
labyrinth,"המבוך</hr>As they ran through the labyrinth of halls, rooms, and passageways, Richard heard the distant toll of the bell, calling people to the devotion to the Lord Rahl. "
lair,"המאורה</hr>Vin sat in the corner of the safe house’s main lair. </hr>Get away from Camon, and the lair, in case something happens. "
lance,לאנס</hr>“Use it like a lance. 
languor,"לנגור</hr>The passing whip of a taskmaster would force them into dedicated motion for a few moments, but as soon as the taskmaster passed, they would return to their languor. "
lapse,"מעידה</hr>She let her pewter, then her copper, lapse. "
lavish,"בזבזני</hr>Perhaps another might have found the room cramped and spartan, but to Vin it seemed lavish. "
lead,"עופרת</hr>Pewter, for instance, is generally accepted as an alloy of tin mixed with lead, with perhaps some copper or silver, depending on the use and the circumstances. "
ledge,"מדף</hr>“You see that ledge down there?” </hr>“I have to go down there, to that ledge,” he told the wisps. </hr>He leaned out over the edge of the cliff, looking down at the ledge far below. </hr>“Kell,” Dockson said, “do you have to stand on the ledge like that? "
ledger,"ספר חשבונות</hr>Renoux asked, pouring over another ledger. "
ledgers,ספרי חשבונות</hr>His idea of “taking lunch” with Vin was to sit and attend to his own duties—making notes on ledgers or dictating letters—while eating. 
leers,"לירים</hr>Richard noticed for the first time that the buttons on Kahlan’s shirt were gone, ripped off, so the shirt hung open, exposing her to the leers of the soldiers. "
lenient,"מקל</hr>“Besides,” Kelsier said, “the Lord Ruler is far more lenient with the nobility than he is with skaa. </hr>In fact, I now know that amongst plantation lords, mine was actually rather lenient.” "
lest,"שמא</hr>She had to put her mind to other things lest she end up being so sad thinking about him that she start to weep. </hr>He extinguished his tin lest his enhanced eyes be blinded when he entered the lit room, and threw open the door. "
lettering,אותיות</hr>She had picked it for its large lettering—was paper really so expensive that scribes needed to cram as many lines to a page as possible? 
levity,"לויטי</hr>“This is no time for levity,” Tepper said sternly. "
ligature,"ליגטורה</hr>“That’s right, take it around and back now to complete the first ligature.” "
Limelights,"זרקורים</hr>“Limelights, Mistress,” Sazed explained. "
limping,"צולע</hr>With that, the older man turned and stalked in a limping gait from the room, slamming the door behind him. "
lintels,"משקופים</hr>The round room had speckled, gray granite pillars all around the outside holding gilded lintels above each passage that went off into darkness. "
loose,"רופף</hr>“I don’t intend to leave any loose ends.” </hr>He wore a loose, sleeveless shirt that exposed a pair of well-sculpted arms. "
lug,לוג</hr>It was a grueling effort to lug the heavy load up the precipitous trail. 
lulled,"רגוע</hr>The only one not lulled into indifference and carelessness was Jagang himself. </hr>Kahlan wanted to blend into the monotony of daily life, to have the men guarding her become lulled into thinking of her as innocuous, harmless, even cowed, so that she became just another one of their tedious chores. "
lumber,ברים</hr>The fires were so intense that the lumber cannot be salvaged. 
lump,"גוש</hr>Richard missed Kahlan so much that it brought a lump to his throat. </hr>It had long since healed over in a lump, becoming a distraction that was hard to ignore. "
lurched,"משובש</hr>Then her body lurched, pulled upward by the belt. "
lying,"משקר</hr>With amusement, he noticed a twisted form lying on the cobblestones a short distance away—the mangled remains of the hazekiller he’d thrown out the window. "
malcontent,חוסר שביעות רצון</hr>It couldn’t have been very effective for a malcontent mob of fools to attack such a place. 
malleable,"חמרן</hr>“Mistwraiths have malleable bodies,” Kelsier said. "
mangled,"מבולבל</hr>With amusement, he noticed a twisted form lying on the cobblestones a short distance away—the mangled remains of the hazekiller he’d thrown out the window. "
manicured,"מטופח</hr>Estates rolled in the distance—each one walled, manicured, and well guarded. "
manor,"מנור</hr>Tresting had his own, personal obligators back at the manor, but they were only minor functionaries, with barely a few marks around their eyes. </hr>The manor house was gone. "
mantic,"מנטיק</hr>Be cautioned, for all true forks and their derivatives are tangled in this mantic root. "
marauders,"הקונדסאים</hr>“The reports are, Excellency, that these marauders are destroying everything in their path. "
marginally,באופן שולי</hr>Traveling through skaa sectors of town could be very dangerous for a man who looked even marginally prosperous. 
Marsh,ביצה</hr>Marsh’s expression darkened. 
marvelous,"נפלא</hr>He is a marvelous actor, but he feels very uncomfortable with people knowing the specifics of how he took Lord Renoux’s place. "
menial,מניאל</hr>Most skaa lived lives of drudgery on the plantations; even those who lived in a city were generally forced to do menial labor. 
mercantile,"מרכנתיל</hr>A few more years of work, some inspired mercantile deals, and who knows?” </hr>The more wealth it had, the better its own mercantile contracts, the more leverage the various Ministry Cantons had with each other—and with the noble houses. "
merlon,מרלון</hr>Chapter 55 Nicci pulled her cloak tighter around herself as she leaned one shoulder up against the great stone merlon. 
mettle,מטל</hr>There was no doubt that she had the mettle. </hr>Johnrock had appeared slightly embarrassed for what he saw as Richard’s lack of mettle. 
miller,"טוחן</hr>He was a big man, a miller, from the southern reaches of the Midlands. "
Ministry,"משרד</hr>The Canton of Finance was hardly the most threatening of Ministry offices—the Canton of Inquisition, or even the Canton of Orthodoxy, had a far more ominous reputation. "
miscreant,"לא מאמין</hr>I’m just a traveling miscreant, here to eat your food and impress your youths.” "
missives,"פספוסים</hr>She wasn't sure why she kept sending her missives, just that she spent so much time writing letters to whichever of her siblings were not in residence in London at the time, and it seemed easy enough to pen a short note to some far-off relative while she was seated at her escritoire. "
Mistress,"פילגש</hr>We are a weak people, Mistress. "
modestly,"בצניעות</hr>“Even among the nobility, Vin, Allomancy is modestly rare,” Kelsier said. "
monotony,"מונוטוניות</hr>Kahlan wanted to blend into the monotony of daily life, to have the men guarding her become lulled into thinking of her as innocuous, harmless, even cowed, so that she became just another one of their tedious chores. "
moping,"ניגוב</hr>Chase would be disappointed to see her giving up so easily, to see her moping, but what was she to do? "
morsels,"חתיכות</hr>Always before, she had needed to be a scrimp with her Luck, holding it in reserve, using up morsels sparingly. "
most,"רוב</hr>Rashek is a tall man—of course, most of these Terrismen are tall. "
Most,"רוב</hr>Most of these have been successfully covered up, and can only be found in the metalminds of Feruchemists or on the pages of banned texts. "
motifs,מוטיבים</hr>You don’t understand the first thing about such complex motifs.” 
motion,"תנועה</hr>It had been a sunny day, and— He squeezed his eyes shut, not certain whether the motion was meant to urge the memory or dispel it. "
muddled,"מבולבל</hr>Mind muddled by terror, she reflexively reached out and Pulled against the ingot, trying to yank herself toward it. "
mundane,"ארצי</hr>He had spoken correctly: The pantry’s offerings had been depressingly mundane. </hr>Vin had never seen him in such mundane clothing before. </hr>Instead of mundane browns and whites, the cultivated plants were of deeper, more vibrant colors—shades of red, orange, and yellow, with the colors concentrated in their leaves. "
murals,"ציורי קיר</hr>In contrast to the simple corridors, this room was covered with silver-inlayed murals. "
navel,"טבור</hr>He turned and poked the goose leg at the young woman’s belly, just below her navel. "
newel,"ניואל</hr>Cara slid across the polished gray marble floor to slow herself enough to make the turn when Nicci hooked a hand on a cold, black marble newel post and charged up the wide, black, granite steps. "
nip,"ניפ</hr>“Losing the stress on the nip,” he said. "
nomadic,נוודים</hr>It wasn’t that she was waking up in an unfamiliar place—traveling with Reen had accustomed her to a nomadic lifestyle. 
nonchalance,"נונשלנטיות</hr>Noblemen feign nonchalance, but the mist makes them uncomfortable.” "
Not,"לא</hr>“Not particularly, no,” Elend said. "
oak,"אלון</hr>They wouldn’t let us proceed any farther than the dead oak woods, or allow us to see the other wisps.” "
obligator,"חובה</hr>The obligator turned, raising an eyebrow—the motion done as if to highlight his most distinctive feature, the intricate tattoos that laced the skin around his eyes. "
oblivious,"מתעלם</hr>The crewleader paused—oblivious of Vin’s touch, yet feeling its effects nonetheless. "
obscurity,"אלמוניות</hr>False Dawn is a stuffy volume, and by not forbidding it, the Ministry doomed it to obscurity.” "
obsidian,"האובסידיאן</hr>That left only the small box that contained her personal effects: a pebble from each city she’d visited, the earring Reen said Vin’s mother had given her, and a bit of obsidian the size of a large coin. "
ominous,"מבשר רעות</hr>The Canton of Finance was hardly the most threatening of Ministry offices—the Canton of Inquisition, or even the Canton of Orthodoxy, had a far more ominous reputation. </hr>Suddenly, with tin, the mists around her didn’t seem so ominous. "
omnipotent,"כל יכול</hr>He’s a powerful Allomancer, but by no means omnipotent.” "
omnipresent,"נוכח בכל מקום</hr>He is the Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.” "
omniscience,ידיעת הכול</hr>Vision through her gift alone had a singular quality that approached omniscience. 
omniscient,"יודע-כל</hr>He is the Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.” "
on,הלאה</hr>Breeze’s attention was still on Yeden and his obvious discomfort. 
one,"אחד</hr>She cradled her cheek in one hand, waiting for the stupefying pain to loosen its grip, waiting for everything around her to come back into focus. "
onslaught,"המתקפה</hr>Even though he charged, wove, and feigned his way through the onslaught of men, he headed relentlessly for that opening, and his freedom. "
ooze,"נוטף</hr>She used a sliver of Subtractive Magic to void a razor-thin piece of flesh at the tip of her finger, and used the blood that began to ooze to begin drawing the diagrams needed before the box of Orden. "
opulence,"שפע</hr>This was a section of Fellise she had rarely seen; despite the town’s opulence, its slums were remarkably similar to the ones in every other city. "
orchards,מטעים</hr>The orchards all the way out into the hills were all cut down. 
orchestra,"תזמורת</hr>A string orchestra played on a platform to her left, providing music for the couples who danced in the very center of the hall. "
ordeal,"חוויה קשה</hr>When Richard went back inside everyone was crowded around Jebra, engaged in hushed conversation filled with sympathy for her ordeal. "
ornamental,"נוי</hr>Cara watched him as he peered around at the paneled walls, his gaze passing methodically over the ornamental oddities on the shelves: the lacquered boxes with inlaid silver designs, the small figures of dancers carved from bone, the smooth stones lying in velvet-lined boxes, and the decorative glass vases. </hr>On burglaries or scouting missions, she had occasionally seen ornamental plants, but she’d never given them much heed—they, like many noble interests, had seemed frivolous to her. "
ornamentation,"קישוט</hr>Still, Vin had rarely worn it, for fear that the ornamentation would make her look more feminine. "
ornate,"מקושט</hr>Richard knew that a number of the rooms were libraries, while others were elaborately decorated rooms seeming to serve no purpose other than to lead to other rooms, which led to other rooms, some simple and some ornate, all a part of the inscrutable and complex maze that was the Keep. </hr>Massive, ornate stone pillars were set into the walls, running between the windows. </hr>And the white one was too ornate. "
ostentatious,"ראוותני</hr>“They’re an ostentatious lot, even for high nobility. </hr>Time to be a bit ostentatious, he thought, dropping a coin to the wood. "
overcoat,"מעיל</hr>The newcomer wore a dull tan overcoat, a pair of brown trousers, and a simple white shirt. "
overhang,"הצפה</hr>Huddled under the small overhang, off to the side, she hoped that no one would answer that knock. "
overseers,"משגיחים</hr>Theron had discovered, however, that those acolytes and their overseers brought down with them large amounts of Ministry funds—disguised as baggage—to be strongholded in Luthadel. "
own,"משלו</hr>She had shooed him out of the room once they had Marina in bed, insisting that he change his own clothing before he caught his death as well. "
packmen,"פקמנים</hr>He is young to receive so much respect from the other packmen. </hr>She watched the packmen for a moment, sensing something . . . odd. "
pallet,"משטחים</hr>She moved to her pallet, the muffled sounds of men laughing and drinking sounding from the other room. "
palpable,מוחשי</hr>There was a palpable sense of danger in the air. 
pandemonium,פנדמוניום</hr>“I can’t control pandemonium on that level. 
pang,"פאנג</hr>Richard felt a pang of loneliness for his mother, a feeling that had visited him from time to time throughout his life. "
pant,מכנסיים</hr>Richard began to pant as his heart pounded out of control. 
panting,מתנשף</hr>She realized that she was panting. 
pantry,"מזווה</hr>He had spoken correctly: The pantry’s offerings had been depressingly mundane. </hr>She brushed past Ulef and hopped out of the trapdoor, moving into a hallway, then a run-down pantry. "
parasol,"שמשייה</hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. </hr>Tresting removed a handkerchief and wiped his brow, thankful for the parasol’s shade against the midday heat. "
patronage,"חסות</hr>Without the Ministry’s patronage, my house is financially doomed.” "
peg,"יתד</hr>He looked up and there, right where he remembered it being, he saw the iron peg. "
penal,"עונשין</hr>It’s not just a penal colony, not just a hellhole where skaa are sent to die. "
Peninsula,"חצי אי</hr>“In a land near the Far Peninsula, a land where people still remember what their old kingdom was called in the days before the Ascension.” "
penned,"עט</hr>“A record that appears to have been penned by the Lord Ruler himself—or, rather, the man who became the Lord Ruler. "
people,"אנשים</hr>On the next day, Kelsier’s words would be repeated to the several hundred people who lived in other hovels. "
perked,הטבה</hr>Vin perked up. </hr>Vin perked up. 
perky,"פרקי</hr>She eyed a yellow gown, but it just seemed a little too . . . perky. "
perpetually,"תָּמִיד</hr>Not only would you run out of it very quickly, but perpetually flaring metals does . . . strange things to people.” "
pertinent,"רלוונטי</hr>As much as he did want to tell it all to her, he wanted to tell her the entire story when he could discuss it, along with some of the questions he had, so he decided for the moment to leave out most of the details and kept it to the pertinent point. "
perverse,סוטה</hr>Zedd had said that the sliph wasn’t being perverse; she simply couldn’t help the way others had created her. 
pesky,מציקים</hr>It was his pesky weight again; it tugged him down. 
pester,מציק</hr>“What did you do at these parties before you had me to pester?” 
petitioning,"עתירה</hr>If they began poking around, they would find that Entrone’s gambling opponent at the night’s bloodfight had been Crews Geffenry—a man whose house had been petitioning the Tekiels for a stronger alliance. "
pewter,"פיוטר</hr>Iron, steel, tin, pewter, copper, bronze, zinc, and brass—the eight basic Allomantic metals. </hr>“I burn pewter,” Ham said. </hr>Taking a deep breath, Kelsier burned pewter, using it to enhance his physical strength much in the same way that tin enhanced his senses. </hr>“That’s pewter. </hr>She let her pewter, then her copper, lapse. "
Pewter,פיוטר</hr>Pewter gave her strength as she turned her eyes toward the buttresslike wall running between the tower and the main keep. 
pilfer,"פילפר</hr>While Yeden secures the city, we’ll pilfer the atium. "
pines,פינס</hr>“You said the wisps wouldn’t let you into the big pines?” 
plantation,"מטע</hr>Yet, he had to be stronger than he looked; few plantation skaa lived to such ages. "
plateau,"הרמה</hr>To that end, out beyond the vast encampment, closer to the plateau, the army was constructing the ramp. "
plume,"הפלומה</hr>To the south, she could see the long plume of dust rising from an approaching supply train. "
plummet,צניחה</hr>She immediately began to plummet toward the ground. 
poet,"משורר</hr>And even though he'd written that his hair was brown, she'd always imagined him as a dark blond, looking rather like a poet (why she always pictured poets with blond hair she did not know). "
poised,"נחוש</hr>Chapter 4 Richard stood transfixed, staring at Nicci poised in midair just above a heavy library table, a net of glowing green geometric lines tangled all around her. "
police,"משטרה</hr>And, where power and riches existed, so did corruption—especially since the Lord Ruler tended to police his nobility far less than he did the skaa. "
pond,"בריכה</hr>He’d been with several other boys, diving down to the bottom of a pond in a contest to retrieve pebbles. </hr>People respectfully made way for the Mord-Sith as she strode up to a spot near the pond. "
ponder,"הרהר</hr>The meeting had ended a short time earlier, Breeze, Ham, and Yeden leaving to ponder the things Kelsier had told them. "
ponderous,"מהורהר</hr>But, because of their size, they are ponderous. "
populace,"אוכלוסייה</hr>We can probably recruit our soldiers from among them, but we can’t count on the general populace.” "
portico,"פורטיקו</hr>The light of a single lantern flickered weakly through the slender windows to either side of the door, reflecting a pale, shimmering glow off the wet floor of the portico. "
portly,"פורטלי</hr>He was older than the soldier, and was a bit portly. "
postulated,"הנחה</hr>They postulated that there was a method to alter people’s memory with Subtractive power in a way that all the resulting disconnected parts of a person’s recollection would spontaneously reconstruct and connect themselves to one another, with the direct consequence being the creation of erroneous memory to fill the voids that had been created when the subject of the conjuring was wiped from people’s minds. "
pragmatism,פרגמטיזם</hr>She needed to approach this adventure with all the practicality and pragmatism with which she always tried to make her decisions. 
preach,"מטיף</hr>Men like you preach change, but I wonder. "
precarious,"מסוכן</hr>Vin’s position had been precarious, and associating with her could have tainted them by association. "
precipitous,תלול</hr>It was a grueling effort to lug the heavy load up the precipitous trail. 
precursor,"קודמן</hr>She needed not power, but its precursor. "
predates,קדם</hr>It predates the great war by seven centuries. 
predestined,גורלי מראש</hr>“The Imperial Order is not predestined to lose just because they are evil. 
predicament,"מצוקה</hr>Chase would have told her not to think of her present predicament, but to keep watching for the time when she could get herself out of it. "
preliminary,ראשוני</hr>I’m only giving you my preliminary impression.” 
premise,"הנחת יסוד</hr>“The premise is pretty simple, really,” Nicci said, offhandedly. "
primly,"ראשוני</hr>Vin sat primly, waiting. "
prodded,"מדרבן</hr>She prodded Liese further as the dance progressed, but he was obviously too inexperienced to know much. "
profane,גסות</hr>She felt ashamed to be among the profane rabble gathered at the feet of such a shining accomplishment of man so proudly rising up before them. 
profound,מעמיק</hr>Breeze’s words had a profound effect. 
prominent,"בולט</hr>Eloise still held a prominent place in society; the Bridgertons were universally adored and respected (and occasionally feared), and Eloise's sunny and irrepressible personality was such that everyone sought out her company, spinsterish age or no. "
prowess,תעוזה</hr>My gentlemanly prowess has reached new depths.” 
prowled,"משוטט</hr>She didn’t walk, she prowled. "
prudent,"זהיר</hr>Besides, I think it’s prudent to keep Renoux’s activities a bit removed from the Lord Ruler.” "
puffs,"חטיפי</hr>The puffs of soot fell like black snowflakes, descending upon the dark city of Luthadel. "
punctuality,דייקנות</hr>“I’m the soul of punctuality.” 
purpose,תכלית</hr>She couldn’t take such suffering again—not when it was to no purpose. 
purview,תחומי עיסוק</hr>For me to be this blind to events that eddy so tightly through my purview can only mean that another witch woman has deliberately occulted those flows from me.” </hr>“But I have had to weigh and consider matters outside your purview and on everything put together I have made my decision. 
quarry,"מחצבה</hr>Vin flew through the mists, eyes straining to keep track of her quarry. "
quelled,"מדוכא</hr>Since she had little interaction with the men—most didn’t even see her—she didn’t know if the executions quelled the rumors but, somehow, she doubted it. "
rabble,אספסוף</hr>She felt ashamed to be among the profane rabble gathered at the feet of such a shining accomplishment of man so proudly rising up before them. 
Rachel,"רייצ'ל</hr>Chapter 26 Rachel yawned. </hr>Violet had said that it was going to take a long time for Rachel to earn forgiveness for such a serious transgression, and also for showing disrespect by escaping the castle. "
rambling,השתוללות</hr>“I’d have never known if I hadn’t started rambling. 
rampart,סוללה</hr>Nicci looked back over her shoulder to see the old wizard marching across the vast rampart. 
rapture,התלהבות</hr>It was rapture. 
rasp,רספ</hr>She could hear it rasp against his stubble. 
recant,"חזרה בתשובה</hr>“Once, the queen sent an emissary to ask if I would recant my vision. "
refinement,"עידון</hr>“Even among thieves, Camon isn’t exactly known for his refinement. </hr>“She’ll need some refinement, however—and not just in appearance.” "
refineries,בתי זיקוק</hr>Luthadel’s main export was metal; the city was home to hundreds of forges and refineries. 
rejuvenation,"התחדשות</hr>Along with the warmth came something else—a feeling of rejuvenation, and of power. "
relent,רלנט</hr>He knows that his father will relent if he acts spoiled enough for long enough.” 
relic,"שריד</hr>In fact, it had been presented in lectures as just that, an oddity, a relic of ancient times, useless, but nonetheless an object of note simply because it had survived. "
Reluctantly,"בחוסר רצון</hr>Reluctantly, Phillip turned away from the sun and opened his eyes. "
remnant,"השריד</hr>She struggled to breathe while she still could, while she still had a remnant of control. "
remnants,"שאריות</hr>The last remnants of the night’s mist had burned away, and the red sun was rising behind the sky’s usual haze of blackish clouds. "
reneging,"חזרה בתשובה</hr>However, if he did try to take control, it would smell of betrayal—a reneging on the promises that he had made to Yeden. "
renowned,הנודע</hr>“Our train also brings some of the Ja’La dh Jin teams that wish to join the tournaments in the hopes of having the chance to one day play His Excellency’s renowned team.” 
reprehensible,מגונה</hr>“It’s a ritual killing reserved for the most reprehensible of sinners: people who misuse Allomancy.” 
residue,שאריות</hr>Zedd had also detected on the sliph the trace residue power left by a witch woman. 
respite,"הפוגה</hr>“Is your respite pleasant, dear?” "
retaliation,"נקמה</hr>23 “THEY SAY THAT THE DEATHS of the Geffenry brothers were a retaliation for the murder of Lord Entrone,” Lady Kliss said quietly. "
reticence,"איפוק</hr>It didn’t seem to her that at this point such reticence to reveal a presence in her mind, if there really was one, would serve any purpose. "
reticent,"שתקן</hr>She had been reticent to use her Luck much since then. </hr>“Master Kelsier is reticent about the Pits, but I sense that the scars he bears from that horrid place go much deeper than the ones you see on his arms. "
revered,"נערץ</hr>He was still widely revered by many people, like Kolo. "
reverently,"ביראת כבוד</hr>Ornate, with carved stone and flowing patterns, the single-story building stood reverently before them. "
rhetorical,"רטורית</hr>“Actually, I—” “It was a rhetorical question, Ham,” Breeze interrupted, rolling his eyes. "
rids,"רוכב</hr>“Riding the rile of the rids to the right,” Spook said with a nod. "
rigid,"נוקשה</hr>“Yes, you know, movement that’s not rigid, not prescribed and inflexible, yet is still deliberate, with specific intent as well as precise objectives. "
rigidity,"קשיחות</hr>Tall and broad-shouldered, he had a statuesque rigidity. "
rile,"ריל</hr>“Riding the rile of the rids to the right,” Spook said with a nod. "
Riot,"מהומות</hr>“Actually,” Kelsier noted, “it seems she can Riot people’s emotions as well.” "
rivulets,ריבולטים</hr>Rain pattered against the glass and ran down in snaking rivulets. 
rote,רוטה</hr>Stop throwing yourselves into your graves as if by rote. 
rouse,Rouse</hr>We can’t rouse her. 
roused,"התעורר</hr>She didn’t look inclined to bother to stand unless Six told her that it was necessary that she do more drawings, but it was clear that her interest had been roused. "
rubble,"הריסות</hr>Chapter 36 Kahlan stepped carefully among the rubble of ancient buildings that had over the millennia crumbled and eventually toppled, sending sections tumbling down the steep hillside. "
ruddy,"אנונימי</hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. "
ruefully,למרבה הצער</hr>The room remained quiet for a moment longer; then the silence was broken as Yeden began to laugh ruefully to himself. 
rugged,"מחוספס</hr>He has charisma, and the women of court would probably describe him as handsome, in a rugged sort of way. "
rumble,"ראמבל</hr>Despite the steady roar of the deluge and the rumble of thunder, it appeared that the village was sound asleep. "
ruse,"רוסה</hr>Kahlan wondered if this was confirmation that he was not in her mind, or if for some reason he was still carrying out a carefully crafted ruse. </hr>If he maintained his impersonation half as well as he maintained order in his mansion, then Vin doubted anyone would ever discover the ruse. "
sack,"שק</hr>He paused near the garden well, and—burning bronze to make certain no Allomancers were near—reached into a stand of bushes to retrieve a large sack. "
sauntering,"מתפתל</hr>The Mistborn crewleader burst through the door with his cheery enthusiasm, Dockson sauntering along behind. "
scalp,קרקפת</hr>His leathered skin and bald scalp made him look more frail than they did wise. 
scant,דל</hr>There are any number of possibilities but at this moment scant evidence to go on. 
Scavengers,אוכלי נבלות</hr>Scavengers.” 
scion,"נצר</hr>“What if, instead, she were simply a young scion I brought with me to Luthadel? "
scowl,"זועף</hr>Cara’s only answer was a scowl. </hr>She put on her best scowl. </hr>She kept glancing up at Vin’s table, covering a scowl. "
scraggly,מקושקש</hr>Her progress across the scraggly landscape was incredibly swift. 
scraped,גרוטאות</hr>Rachel could hardly eat because her tongue was so raw and scraped—not that they gave her much to eat anyway. 
scrawny,"קשקוש</hr>Indeed, she was hardly enticing; scrawny with a youthful face, she supposedly didn’t even look her sixteen years. "
scribbling,"שרבוט</hr>She didn’t add that she knew, from peeking through the keyhole, that he was sitting at his desk scribbling on some papers. "
scribe,"סופר</hr>Then the two crossed through the entry chamber—passing the overweight crewleader, who stood speaking with a scribe. "
scribes,"סופרים</hr>“Some of Clubs’s apprentices occasionally work as scribes,” Kelsier said. </hr>She had picked it for its large lettering—was paper really so expensive that scribes needed to cram as many lines to a page as possible? "
scrimp,"סקרמפ</hr>Always before, she had needed to be a scrimp with her Luck, holding it in reserve, using up morsels sparingly. "
scrounge,"סקרונג'</hr>“There’s a fresh bath for you in the room at the end of the hallway, and I had Clubs scrounge you up a few changes of clothing. "
scurried,"התרוצץ</hr>He seemed only too eager to do her bidding and scurried off. </hr>She watched him approach the base of the wall, then scurried over to him. "
scuttled,"להטביע</hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. "
scuttling,"Scuttling</hr>As he landed on a rooftop, he caught a glimpse of Hoid scuttling over to pluck the coin off the ground. "
seamstress,תופרת</hr>My wife is a seamstress there; she tells people I’m in the Luthadel Garrison.” 
sediment,משקעים</hr>“So you get some of the sediment.” 
Seemingly,"כנראה</hr>Seemingly in sympathy with the tempestuous intensity of the lightning out beyond the wall of windows, the air in the room fairly crackled with the power that had been focused into what was obviously, even to Richard’s untrained eye, an extraordinary conjuring. "
seer,"רואה</hr>Still, her momentum had whipped the seer down around and under the balcony, where her leg smacked a support strut that broke her leg. "
semblance,"מראית עין</hr>Even so, there was a semblance of sight; there were colors and, on occasion, obscure shapes that seemed to loom up and just as quickly vanish. "
serene,שלווה</hr>She felt . . . serene. 
servile,"העבדים</hr>Never ones to be servile, the two nonetheless showed no evidence of wanting to argue with their stormy leader. "
shabby,"עלוב</hr>The garment wasn’t shabby, but nor was it as rich as others at the party. "
shaft,"פיר</hr>She released some of the tension and let the lock lower, then jerked it a little, twitching it rapidly up and down, trying to jiggle the shaft of the metal bar up through the hoop. "
shafts,"פירים</hr>With shafts as wide as an eye socket, the nail-like spikes were long enough that their sharp points jutted out about an inch from the back of the man’s clean-shaven skull. "
shank,שוק</hr>The loop of the string was just below the end of the lock’s shank. 
shawl,"הצעיף</hr>She stepped to the side, handing her shawl to an attendant, and Sazed relaxed beside her. </hr>They stepped up to the squat ballroom building—one of several low wings extending from the main keep—and a servant took her shawl. "
shears,"שירס</hr>As soon as Violet had Rachel back, one of the first things she did was take a big pair of shears and chop off Rachel’s long, beautiful blond hair. "
sheaths,"נדנים</hr>Kelsier nodded, tying on the belt—it had no buckle, but it did contain two small sheaths. "
shin,"שין</hr>Rather than admitting defeat, and before she blacked out from lack of air, she used all her muscle to drive the heel of her boot into his shin. "
shivering,"רועד</hr>He realized that he was shivering, but he couldn’t seem to make himself stop. "
shone,"זרח</hr>The flat spike ends shone like two silvery disks, sticking out of the sockets in the front, where the eyes should have been. "
shooing,"שושינג</hr>And then he just found himself shooing them off, telling them to go back to their nurse. "
signifies,"מסמל</hr>""It hardly signifies, anyway."" "
silhouette,"צללית</hr>Atop the balcony railing, a dark silhouette blotted out the moonlit countryside beyond. </hr>Behind, Six appeared in the opening through the wall, a black silhouette against the sunrise. "
silhouetted,"צללית</hr>Just below it, Kelsier could see the silhouetted tip of a dark peak. "
simplistic,"פשטני</hr>It has a level of brashness that you might find appealing, but you would find the theology simplistic.” "
simply,פשוט</hr>Vin wasn’t on duty; the watch-hole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude. 
sinuous,סינוס</hr>A sinuous smile slipped across Six’s features. 
Sisters,אחיות</hr>Those four Sisters of the Dark had—on Kahlan. 
slender,"דק</hr>The light of a single lantern flickered weakly through the slender windows to either side of the door, reflecting a pale, shimmering glow off the wet floor of the portico. </hr>She looked over her shoulder and was startled to see a slender girl with short, dark hair standing timidly just at the edge of the faint lanternlight. "
slit,לשסף</hr>Her boots wouldn’t fit through the slit. 
slouch,"סלואוץ'</hr>She walked with a slouch, eyes down, sticking near to the side of the street. "
sluggish,"איטי</hr>“I see them being sluggish, even for skaa. "
sluggishness,"איטיות</hr>There was a sluggishness to their efforts—but, of course, that was the way of the skaa. "
slums,"שכונות עוני</hr>They live in slums, work in mills and smithies the entire day, and half of them still starve.” "
sly,ערמומי</hr>His smile grew sly. 
smidgen,סמידגן</hr>She expended just a smidgen; she’d need the rest for the job. 
smocks,"סמוקים</hr>Hundreds of people in brown smocks worked in the falling ash, caring for the crops. "
smoldering,"סמולדרינג</hr>Only a blackened, smoldering scar remained. "
sniffling,"רחרוח</hr>Vin realized she was sniffling slightly, and she felt a tear on her cheek. "
soil,אדמה</hr>He supposed the ash must break down into soil eventually. 
solemn,"חגיגי</hr>“Don’t look so solemn, my dear fellow,” Breeze said. "
solitude,בדידות</hr>Vin wasn’t on duty; the watch-hole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude. 
somber,"קודר</hr>Anyone who spent any time with her would have surely thought she'd prefer something darker, more somber. "
soot,"פיח</hr>Ashfalls weren’t that uncommon in the Final Empire, but Tresting had hoped to avoid getting soot stains on his fine new suit coat and red vest, which had just arrived via canal boat from Luthadel itself. </hr>Working with their heads bowed, bodies stained by soot and sweat, they were so hard to tell apart. </hr>The puffs of soot fell like black snowflakes, descending upon the dark city of Luthadel. </hr>He wasn’t dirtied by soot—none of the crew had ever been, the few times Vin had seen them. "
Soother,"סותר</hr>“Soother, eh?” "
soothing,"מרגיע</hr>“There will be room,” Sister Armina said with soothing assurance, cutting off Sister Cecilia’s habit of always assuming the worst. "
sound,קול</hr>It seemed sound. 
sowed,"זרע</hr>Anyway, when he went to the Temple of the Winds he sowed the seeds for their cause to rise again at some future time. "
spartan,"ספרטני</hr>Perhaps another might have found the room cramped and spartan, but to Vin it seemed lavish. "
spectacles,משקפיים</hr>Why is he wearing spectacles? 
spike,"ספייק</hr>As he turned, Kelsier was able to see that a thick metal spike had been pounded tip-first through each of the man’s eyes. "
squabble,"להתקוטט</hr>“He’s known to let his nobility squabble, probably to keep them off-balance. "
squabbling,"התקוטטות</hr>“If the houses would stop squabbling, we might be able to gain some real power in the government—rather than just bow to the whims of the Lord Ruler.” "
squander,"בזבוז</hr>High nobles kept different schedules from regular people; the ability to afford, even squander, lamp oil and candles meant that the wealthy didn’t have to bow before the whims of season or sun. "
squirm,"להתפתל</hr>However, Sazed’s calm displeasure made her want to squirm. "
squirmed,התפתל</hr>Vin squirmed a bit beneath their scrutiny. 
stalked,"גבעול</hr>With that, the older man turned and stalked in a limping gait from the room, slamming the door behind him. "
staves,"סטבס</hr>However, we’re going to need more than staves. "
sterile,"עקר</hr>Otherwise, without the key, everything that has come before, meaning what has been used from this book, will not only be sterile, but fatal. "
stern,"שטרן</hr>He hadn't seen his children yet today, and he supposed he ought to, but he didn't want to spoil the day by saying something stern, which he inevitably seemed to do. "
sternly,"בחומרה</hr>“This is no time for levity,” Tepper said sternly. "
steward,"דייל</hr>“You mean, how did a Terrisman steward end up as part of a rebellion intending to overthrow the Final Empire?” "
stewards,דיילים</hr>“But I know that the high nobility prefer Terrismen stewards and attendants.” 
stipend,"קצבה</hr>The Great Houses get to buy a monthly stipend of atium, which is one of the main ways the Lord Ruler controls them. "
stool,"שרפרף</hr>Six hadn’t cared at all about the stool. </hr>The boy who had fetched Vin sat on a stool beside Clubs, and he was obviously making a point of trying not to look at her. </hr>He sat on the stool by her bed, hands clasped with his elbows on his knees, watching her by the faint light of a lantern. "
stout,סטאוט</hr>She stopped when she saw a stout branch lying on the ground. 
stretches,מותח</hr>People don’t come here for stretches.” 
strife,"מריבות</hr>He said that it’s a time of great strife among the wisps, great sadness and worry. "
strike,שביתה</hr>It was a perfectly executed strike. 
strode,סטרוד</hr>People respectfully made way for the Mord-Sith as she strode up to a spot near the pond. 
structures,"מבנים</hr>In the sporadic displays of distant lightning, she could just make out the hulking shoulders of dark structures standing like ghosts beyond the billowing sheets of rain. "
stubble,זיפים</hr>She could hear it rasp against his stubble. 
stud,"פתוח</hr>Little more than a stud, not even worth stealing, which was why she didn’t fear leaving it in the back room. </hr>“It’s just a small stud, and the pin on the back bends down.” "
studs,"ומשובץ</hr>His earlobes had been stretched out, and the ears themselves contained studs that ran around their perimeter. "
stumble,למעוד</hr>I fear that I’ll stumble from nervousness on the dance floor. 
subdue,"להכניע</hr>There was something quietly noble about her spirit, about the way the figure stood with her back arched, her hands fisted, and her head thrown back as if in defiance of invisible forces that would subdue her. "
subjugation,"שעבוד</hr>We are eager to do as we are told, quick to seek subjugation. "
subservient,"כנוע</hr>The skaa might be subservient, but they were incurable gossips. </hr>Make sure you remain subservient, Camon. "
suffocate,"חנק</hr>The wrong fit, however, can suffocate.” "
suffused,"ספוג</hr>He felt suffused with her presence, as if he had really been with her, only to be pulled away by being awake. "
suitor,"מחזר</hr>“A suitor,” Vin said. "
survived,"שרד</hr>CHAPTER ONE I have survived Day Three Post-Christian, and my first day at work. "
swindle,"נוכלות</hr>“Camon tried to swindle Marsh a few months ago, and he brought the girl with him then, too. "
sympathetic,סימפטי</hr>“A nobleman sympathetic to the skaa? 
tailored,"המותאמים</hr>It seemed to have been tailored to be loose and relaxed, defying the traditional sharp, well-cut fashion. "
tally,"טלי</hr>“Excellency, there were numbers beyond counting, and I stopped counting at several thousand without having made much headway in a full tally. "
tantrums,"התפרצויות זעם</hr>Not like you, a pompous little twit who thinks herself important because of the extravagance of her tantrums, but a real queen. "
tapered,"מחודד</hr>As it came closer, Richard saw that it looked more like numerous arms—tapered, long, undulating objects—fanning open from a central element that for some reason he could not quite figure out. "
tapping,"הקשה</hr>He reached inside with his mind and touched the tin, tapping powers he still barely understood. "
tardiness,"איחורים</hr>“I suppose his tardiness leaves us with a chance for some refreshment. </hr>“Are we to receive any explanation for your tardiness?” </hr>“. . . don’t regret my tardiness,” a familiar voice said from inside. "
teetered,"מתנודד</hr>It teetered, then fell out the window and began to plummet directly toward Kelsier. "
telltale,"מסגיר</hr>Zedd stared off as he puzzled at the question, the way one would listen for any sound, but Nicci knew that he wasn’t exactly listening for a telltale sound. "
temerity,"תעוזה</hr>Even now, more than a month after it had happened, he couldn't quite believe that the sun had had the temerity to tease him so. "
tenacious,"עקשן</hr>He was nothing if not tenacious. </hr>No, she reflected with a rather impressive (in her opinion, at least) display of self-honesty, there were two things about her that colored her every action— she liked to act quickly and she was tenacious. "
tenaciously,"בעקשנות</hr>Other than Kahlan, he didn’t know anyone who could focus on a goal as tenaciously as Nicci. "
tendrils,קנוקנות</hr>We know how to avoid the Steel Ministry’s tendrils. 
tenements,"שיכונים</hr>The tenements and shops were uniform in appearance; this was not a place to draw attention to oneself. </hr>My family doesn’t have to live in packed skaa tenements, nor do they have to worry about starving. "
tentative,לא סופי</hr>Vin accepted her cup with a tentative hand. 
tentatively,"בהיסוס</hr>She reached out tentatively—not even really sure what she was doing, or why she could even do it. "
textile,"טקסטיל</hr>Well, scamming noblemen and obligators was a very dangerous profession—but it certainly beat working in the forges or the textile mills. "
the,"ה</hr>“Once, the queen sent an emissary to ask if I would recant my vision. </hr>The Mistborn crewleader burst through the door with his cheery enthusiasm, Dockson sauntering along behind. "
The,ה</hr>The safe appeared over the lip of the floor above. 
theocracy,תאוקרטיה</hr>“Those Inquisitors won’t just let us throw their pretty theocracy into chaos.” 
There,"שם</hr>“There will be room,” Sister Armina said with soothing assurance, cutting off Sister Cecilia’s habit of always assuming the worst. "
thigh,"ירך</hr>His thigh was swollen and painful to the touch but, fortunately, not torn open. "
thighs,הירכיים</hr>Her thighs ached with the effort. 
this,זה</hr>“And how does this connect with the symbols at the First Wizard’s enclave?” 
thought,"מחשבה</hr>Even Phillip, who'd thought himself impervious to the vagaries of the weather, had felt his spirits lighten, his smile widen. "
threes,שלשות</hr>I think it would be best to shield it behind an invocation of threes.” 
throbbed,פועם</hr>Her back still throbbed; Camon had whipped her the day before. 
Thug,בריון</hr>“I’m a Thug.” 
thump,חבטה</hr>You won’t even— A muted thump sounded as someone dropped a stack of books onto her table. 
tidbits,"tidbits</hr>“But, sometimes, there are little tidbits of information floating around, things people saw or overheard, and the people who saw or overheard them start to gossip about those tasty tidbits. </hr>She would probably have to figure out what that meant on her own; experience told her that a powerful man like Kelsier would withhold knowledge from her as long as he could, stringing her along with occasional tidbits. "
timid,"ביישן</hr>She was paranoid, true, but not timid. "
