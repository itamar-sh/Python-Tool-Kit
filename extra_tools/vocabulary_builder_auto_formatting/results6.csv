retaliation,"נקמה<hr>23 “THEY SAY THAT THE DEATHS of the Geffenry brothers were a retaliation for the murder of Lord Entrone,” Lady Kliss said quietly. "
reticence,"איפוק<hr>It didn’t seem to her that at this point such reticence to reveal a presence in her mind, if there really was one, would serve any purpose. "
reticent,"שתקן<hr>She had been reticent to use her Luck much since then. </hr>“Master Kelsier is reticent about the Pits, but I sense that the scars he bears from that horrid place go much deeper than the ones you see on his arms. "
revered,"נערץ<hr>He was still widely revered by many people, like Kolo. "
reverently,"ביראת כבוד<hr>Ornate, with carved stone and flowing patterns, the single-story building stood reverently before them. "
rhetorical,"רטורית<hr>“Actually, I—” “It was a rhetorical question, Ham,” Breeze interrupted, rolling his eyes. "
rids,"רוכב<hr>“Riding the rile of the rids to the right,” Spook said with a nod. "
rigid,"נוקשה<hr>“Yes, you know, movement that’s not rigid, not prescribed and inflexible, yet is still deliberate, with specific intent as well as precise objectives. "
rigidity,"קשיחות<hr>Tall and broad-shouldered, he had a statuesque rigidity. "
rile,"ריל<hr>“Riding the rile of the rids to the right,” Spook said with a nod. "
Riot,"מהומות<hr>“Actually,” Kelsier noted, “it seems she can Riot people’s emotions as well.” "
rivulets,ריבולטים<hr>Rain pattered against the glass and ran down in snaking rivulets. 
rote,רוטה<hr>Stop throwing yourselves into your graves as if by rote. 
rouse,Rouse<hr>We can’t rouse her. 
roused,"התעורר<hr>She didn’t look inclined to bother to stand unless Six told her that it was necessary that she do more drawings, but it was clear that her interest had been roused. "
rubble,"הריסות<hr>Chapter 36 Kahlan stepped carefully among the rubble of ancient buildings that had over the millennia crumbled and eventually toppled, sending sections tumbling down the steep hillside. "
ruddy,"אנונימי<hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. "
ruefully,למרבה הצער<hr>The room remained quiet for a moment longer; then the silence was broken as Yeden began to laugh ruefully to himself. 
rugged,"מחוספס<hr>He has charisma, and the women of court would probably describe him as handsome, in a rugged sort of way. "
rumble,"ראמבל<hr>Despite the steady roar of the deluge and the rumble of thunder, it appeared that the village was sound asleep. "
ruse,"רוסה<hr>Kahlan wondered if this was confirmation that he was not in her mind, or if for some reason he was still carrying out a carefully crafted ruse. </hr>If he maintained his impersonation half as well as he maintained order in his mansion, then Vin doubted anyone would ever discover the ruse. "
sack,"שק<hr>He paused near the garden well, and—burning bronze to make certain no Allomancers were near—reached into a stand of bushes to retrieve a large sack. "
sauntering,"מתפתל<hr>The Mistborn crewleader burst through the door with his cheery enthusiasm, Dockson sauntering along behind. "
scalp,קרקפת<hr>His leathered skin and bald scalp made him look more frail than they did wise. 
scant,דל<hr>There are any number of possibilities but at this moment scant evidence to go on. 
Scavengers,אוכלי נבלות<hr>Scavengers.” 
scion,"נצר<hr>“What if, instead, she were simply a young scion I brought with me to Luthadel? "
scowl,"זועף<hr>Cara’s only answer was a scowl. </hr>She put on her best scowl. </hr>She kept glancing up at Vin’s table, covering a scowl. "
scraggly,מקושקש<hr>Her progress across the scraggly landscape was incredibly swift. 
scraped,גרוטאות<hr>Rachel could hardly eat because her tongue was so raw and scraped—not that they gave her much to eat anyway. 
scrawny,"קשקוש<hr>Indeed, she was hardly enticing; scrawny with a youthful face, she supposedly didn’t even look her sixteen years. "
scribbling,"שרבוט<hr>She didn’t add that she knew, from peeking through the keyhole, that he was sitting at his desk scribbling on some papers. "
scribe,"סופר<hr>Then the two crossed through the entry chamber—passing the overweight crewleader, who stood speaking with a scribe. "
scribes,"סופרים<hr>“Some of Clubs’s apprentices occasionally work as scribes,” Kelsier said. </hr>She had picked it for its large lettering—was paper really so expensive that scribes needed to cram as many lines to a page as possible? "
scrimp,"סקרמפ<hr>Always before, she had needed to be a scrimp with her Luck, holding it in reserve, using up morsels sparingly. "
scrounge,"סקרונג'<hr>“There’s a fresh bath for you in the room at the end of the hallway, and I had Clubs scrounge you up a few changes of clothing. "
scurried,"התרוצץ<hr>He seemed only too eager to do her bidding and scurried off. </hr>She watched him approach the base of the wall, then scurried over to him. "
scuttled,"להטביע<hr>Lord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his servants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his distinguished guest. "
scuttling,"Scuttling<hr>As he landed on a rooftop, he caught a glimpse of Hoid scuttling over to pluck the coin off the ground. "
seamstress,תופרת<hr>My wife is a seamstress there; she tells people I’m in the Luthadel Garrison.” 
sediment,משקעים<hr>“So you get some of the sediment.” 
Seemingly,"כנראה<hr>Seemingly in sympathy with the tempestuous intensity of the lightning out beyond the wall of windows, the air in the room fairly crackled with the power that had been focused into what was obviously, even to Richard’s untrained eye, an extraordinary conjuring. "
seer,"רואה<hr>Still, her momentum had whipped the seer down around and under the balcony, where her leg smacked a support strut that broke her leg. "
semblance,"מראית עין<hr>Even so, there was a semblance of sight; there were colors and, on occasion, obscure shapes that seemed to loom up and just as quickly vanish. "
serene,שלווה<hr>She felt . . . serene. 
servile,"העבדים<hr>Never ones to be servile, the two nonetheless showed no evidence of wanting to argue with their stormy leader. "
shabby,"עלוב<hr>The garment wasn’t shabby, but nor was it as rich as others at the party. "
shaft,"פיר<hr>She released some of the tension and let the lock lower, then jerked it a little, twitching it rapidly up and down, trying to jiggle the shaft of the metal bar up through the hoop. "
shafts,"פירים<hr>With shafts as wide as an eye socket, the nail-like spikes were long enough that their sharp points jutted out about an inch from the back of the man’s clean-shaven skull. "
shank,שוק<hr>The loop of the string was just below the end of the lock’s shank. 
shawl,"הצעיף<hr>She stepped to the side, handing her shawl to an attendant, and Sazed relaxed beside her. </hr>They stepped up to the squat ballroom building—one of several low wings extending from the main keep—and a servant took her shawl. "
shears,"שירס<hr>As soon as Violet had Rachel back, one of the first things she did was take a big pair of shears and chop off Rachel’s long, beautiful blond hair. "
sheaths,"נדנים<hr>Kelsier nodded, tying on the belt—it had no buckle, but it did contain two small sheaths. "
shin,"שין<hr>Rather than admitting defeat, and before she blacked out from lack of air, she used all her muscle to drive the heel of her boot into his shin. "
shivering,"רועד<hr>He realized that he was shivering, but he couldn’t seem to make himself stop. "
shone,"זרח<hr>The flat spike ends shone like two silvery disks, sticking out of the sockets in the front, where the eyes should have been. "
shooing,"שושינג<hr>And then he just found himself shooing them off, telling them to go back to their nurse. "
signifies,"מסמל<hr>""It hardly signifies, anyway."" "
silhouette,"צללית<hr>Atop the balcony railing, a dark silhouette blotted out the moonlit countryside beyond. </hr>Behind, Six appeared in the opening through the wall, a black silhouette against the sunrise. "
silhouetted,"צללית<hr>Just below it, Kelsier could see the silhouetted tip of a dark peak. "
simplistic,"פשטני<hr>It has a level of brashness that you might find appealing, but you would find the theology simplistic.” "
simply,פשוט<hr>Vin wasn’t on duty; the watch-hole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude. 
sinuous,סינוס<hr>A sinuous smile slipped across Six’s features. 
Sisters,אחיות<hr>Those four Sisters of the Dark had—on Kahlan. 
slender,"דק<hr>The light of a single lantern flickered weakly through the slender windows to either side of the door, reflecting a pale, shimmering glow off the wet floor of the portico. </hr>She looked over her shoulder and was startled to see a slender girl with short, dark hair standing timidly just at the edge of the faint lanternlight. "
slit,לשסף<hr>Her boots wouldn’t fit through the slit. 
slouch,"סלואוץ'<hr>She walked with a slouch, eyes down, sticking near to the side of the street. "
sluggish,"איטי<hr>“I see them being sluggish, even for skaa. "
sluggishness,"איטיות<hr>There was a sluggishness to their efforts—but, of course, that was the way of the skaa. "
slums,"שכונות עוני<hr>They live in slums, work in mills and smithies the entire day, and half of them still starve.” "
sly,ערמומי<hr>His smile grew sly. 
smidgen,סמידגן<hr>She expended just a smidgen; she’d need the rest for the job. 
smocks,"סמוקים<hr>Hundreds of people in brown smocks worked in the falling ash, caring for the crops. "
smoldering,"סמולדרינג<hr>Only a blackened, smoldering scar remained. "
sniffling,"רחרוח<hr>Vin realized she was sniffling slightly, and she felt a tear on her cheek. "
soil,אדמה<hr>He supposed the ash must break down into soil eventually. 
solemn,"חגיגי<hr>“Don’t look so solemn, my dear fellow,” Breeze said. "
solitude,בדידות<hr>Vin wasn’t on duty; the watch-hole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude. 
somber,"קודר<hr>Anyone who spent any time with her would have surely thought she'd prefer something darker, more somber. "
soot,"פיח<hr>Ashfalls weren’t that uncommon in the Final Empire, but Tresting had hoped to avoid getting soot stains on his fine new suit coat and red vest, which had just arrived via canal boat from Luthadel itself. </hr>Working with their heads bowed, bodies stained by soot and sweat, they were so hard to tell apart. </hr>The puffs of soot fell like black snowflakes, descending upon the dark city of Luthadel. </hr>He wasn’t dirtied by soot—none of the crew had ever been, the few times Vin had seen them. "
Soother,"סותר<hr>“Soother, eh?” "
soothing,"מרגיע<hr>“There will be room,” Sister Armina said with soothing assurance, cutting off Sister Cecilia’s habit of always assuming the worst. "
sound,קול<hr>It seemed sound. 
sowed,"זרע<hr>Anyway, when he went to the Temple of the Winds he sowed the seeds for their cause to rise again at some future time. "
spartan,"ספרטני<hr>Perhaps another might have found the room cramped and spartan, but to Vin it seemed lavish. "
spectacles,משקפיים<hr>Why is he wearing spectacles? 
spike,"ספייק<hr>As he turned, Kelsier was able to see that a thick metal spike had been pounded tip-first through each of the man’s eyes. "
squabble,"להתקוטט<hr>“He’s known to let his nobility squabble, probably to keep them off-balance. "
