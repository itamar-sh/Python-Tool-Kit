# Sort
We familiar with classic algorithm sorts of O(n*log(n)) and some algorithms of O(n) in case of some assumption on the elements size.

The attributes of sorting algorithms are:
1) In Place - If the algorithm return new array or use more than constant space is not in place.
2) Stable - Only relevant for In Place algorithm - Return array with the original order of two equilvant elements.

# Classic algorithms
QuickSort, BubbleSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort

# O(n) - algorithms, using assumptions of course
RadixSort, BucketSort, CountingSort
